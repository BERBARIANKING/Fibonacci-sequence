# History of the Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is named for Leonardo Pisano (also known Fibonacci), an Italian mathematician who lived from 1170 to 1250. Fibonacci considered the sequence to be an answer to the following question:

"How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with a single pair, if in every month each pair bears a new pair which becomes productive from the second month on?" The result can be expressed numerically as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

A Sanskrit grammarian, Pingala, is credited with the first mention of the sequence of numbers, sometime between the fifth century B.C. and the second or third century A.D. Since Fibonacci introduced the series to Western civilization, it has had a high profile from time to time. In The Da Vinci Code, for example, the Fibonacci sequence is part of an important clue. Another application, the Fibonacci poem, is a verse in which the progression of syllable numbers per line follows Fibonacci's pattern.

Fibonacci numbers can also be used to define a spiral and are of interest to biologists and physicists because they are frequently observed in various natural objects and phenomena. The branching patterns in trees and leaves, for example, and the distribution of seeds in a raspberry reflect the Fibonacci sequence.
